## About 📝
Research Literature Summarizer (RLS) is a NLP model that takes research literatures and give summaries containing only vital information, including information not included in the abstarct section of the research paper.

RLS is targeted at researchers, university students, high school students and other people who deal with literature reviews. 

RLS reduces the amount of time spent on literature reviews, leading to increased productivity and lowered associated stress.
